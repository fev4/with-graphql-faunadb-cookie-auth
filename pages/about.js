      <h1>The Idea Behind This Example</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/client/">Apollo</a> is a GraphQL
        client that allows you to easily query the exact data you need from a
        GraphQL server. In addition to fetching and mutating data, Apollo
        analyzes your queries and their results to construct a client-side cache
        of your data, which is kept up to date as further queries and mutations
        are run, fetching more results from the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this simple example, we integrate Apollo seamlessly with{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js">Next</a> by wrapping our Page
        component inside a{' '}
        <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html">
          higher-order component (HOC)
        </a>
        . Using the HOC pattern we're able to pass down a central store of query
        result data created by Apollo into our React component hierarchy defined
        inside a page of our Next application.
      </p>
      <p>
        On initial page load, while on the server and inside getInitialProps, we
        invoke the Apollo method,{' '}
        <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-ssr/#getdatafromtree">
          getDataFromTree
        </a>
        . This method returns a promise; at the point in which the promise
        resolves, our Apollo Client store is completely initialized.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example relies on <a href="http://graph.cool">graph.cool</a> for
        its GraphQL backend.
